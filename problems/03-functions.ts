// This problem is about creating typed functions and using enums.

// 1.  Create an enumeration named 'Weekday'. It should have members for MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
//     THURSDAY, and FRIDAY.

// 2.  Create a function named 'isBusinessDay'.
//     - It should accept one parameter named 'day' of type 'Weekday'.
//     - It should return a value of type 'boolean'.
//     - The function should return 'true' if the day is any weekday. For this exercise,
//       simply ensure it returns true for any valid enum member you've defined.

// Write your code below this line

export enum Weekday {
  // Add enum members here
}

export function isBusinessDay(day: Weekday): boolean {
  // Implement the function logic here
  return false;
}
